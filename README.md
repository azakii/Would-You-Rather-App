## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity has provided a pseudo backend server for students to develop against. The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend. The required files have been incorporated into this project.
